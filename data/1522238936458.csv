F1522238936458_S25,defendant claim,"This was also reaffirmed by the Hon'ble SAT in Manoj Gaur v. SEBI (Appeal No 64 of 2012). v. In the present case, it is submitted that the Sale Transactions were No motivated by the UPSI. "

F1522238936458_S40,defendant claim,..where an entity is privy to unpublished price sensitive information it will tend to purchase shares and No sell the shares prior to the unpublished price sensitive information becoming public if the information is positive 
F1522238936458_S41,defendant claim,".A person who is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information which, on becoming public is likely to cause a positive impact on the price of the scrip, would only buy shares and would No sell the shares before the unpublished price sensitive information becomes public and would immediately offload the shares post the information becoming public."
F1522238936458_S42,defendant claim,We are also inclined to accept the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant that where an entity is privy to unpublished price sensitive information it will tend to purchase shares and No sell the shares prior to the unpublished price sensitive information becoming public if the information is positive.
F1522238936458_S43,defendant claim," In this case declaration of financial results, dividend and bonus were positive information but the appellant No only bought but also sold the shares No only during the period when the price sensitive information was unpublished but also prior to and after the information becoming public.

F1522238936458_S44,defendant claim,"A person who is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information which, on becoming public is likely to cause a positive impact on the price of the scrip, would only buy shares and would No sell the shares before the unpublished price sensitive information becomes public and would immediately offload the shares post the information becoming public. "
F1522238936458_S45,defendant claim,This is No so in the case under consideration.
F1522238936458_S46,defendant claim,"The trading pattern of the appellant, as shown in the chart above, does No lead to the conclusion that the appellant's trades were induced by the unpublished price sensitive information."

F1522238936458_S48,defendant claim,"In that case, the learned authorized representative of the appellant admitted that charge of insider trading stood established against the appellant."
F1522238936458_S49,defendant claim," Further, appellants in that appeal only purchased the shares while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information and there was no trading by them prior to or after the information becoming public."
F1522238936458_S50,defendant claim,"In the case in hand the charge of trading on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information has No only been denied by the appellant, it has also been able to demonstrate through her trading pattern that the trading was No based on the unpublished price sensitive information."
F1522238936458_S51,defendant claim,"We, therefore, cannot uphold the impugned order ..."""
F1522238936458_S52,defendant claim, ix. The UPSI in question pertains to the unaudited quarterly results of VIL for the quarter ended December 2009.
F1522238936458_S53,defendant claim,"VIL had, for the quarter in question, recorded a profit of Rs. 0.10 crores."
F1522238936458_S54,defendant claim,"This is in contrast to the preceding quarter, where it had recorded a loss of Rs. 0.17 crores."
F1522238936458_S55,defendant claim,Clearly therefore the information in question was positive in nature. 
F1522238936458_S56,defendant claim,This is also borne out by the movement of the price of the scrip.
F1522238936458_S57,defendant claim,"While the weighted average price of the scrip on the BSE on February 1, 2010 (the date of the Sale Transaction) was Rs. 26.25, the same had increased by more than 53% to Rs. 40.25 on February 8, 2010, after the quarterly results were announced to the market on February 6, 2010."
F1522238936458_S58,defendant claim,"Clearly therefore, the information was positive in nature, and any insider seeking to profit from the same would buy, and No sell, in advance of such positive information being made public."
F1522238936458_S59,defendant claim," x. The Sale Transaction was absolutely contrary to the positive nature of the information, which establishes that the charge that the Sale Transaction was motivated by possession of UPSI is untenable. "
F1522238936458_S60,defendant claim,Vasparr's conduct clearly shows that the Sale Transaction was No in fact connected in any way to the alleged UPSI but was inter alia for the purpose of meeting the payment of liabilities of YCL.
F1522238936458_S61,defendant claim,xi. It is therefore submitted that Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) cannot be held to have violated Regulations 3(i) and 4 of the 1992 PIT Regulations.
F1522238936458_S62,defendant claim,No violation of Regulation 7(1A) of the 1997 SAST Regulations:
F1522238936458_S63,defendant claim," xii. The SCN alleges that Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) is in violation of Regulation 7(1A) of the 1997 SAST Regulations , as the requisite disclosure of the Sale Transaction was made on February 4, 2010, thereby occasioning a delay of one day."
F1522238936458_S64,defendant claim,"xiii. The SAT has in Ravi Mohan & Others v. SEBI (Appeal No.97 of 2014, Order dated December 16, 20 15), categorically ruled that Regulation 7(1A) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations does No require disclosure of such transactions, in view of Regulation 7(2) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations."
F1522238936458_S65,defendant claim,"The Hon'ble Tribunal observed that: ""Therefore, when the Takeover Regulations, 1997 provides that the disclosure obligation specified under regulation 7(1A) has to be discharged in the manner specified under regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) and regulation 7(2) does No provide for disclosure in relation to sale of shares in excess of the limits prescribed under regulation 7(1A), SEBI is No justified in holding that the appellants by failing to make disclosure of sales covered under regulation 7(1A) within the stipulated time, have violated regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997."
F1522238936458_S66,defendant claim,"Consequently, SEBI is No justified in imposing penalty on the appellants."
F1522238936458_S67,defendant claim," It is apparent that after having specified two days time for complying with the obligation specified under regulation 7(1A), there was no need for SEBI to amend regulation 7(2) in relation to the disclosure obligation under regulation 7(1A). "
F1522238936458_S68,defendant claim,"In any event, having deemed it fit to amend regulation 7(2), SEBI ought to have ensured that regulation 7(2) as amended contains a clause relating to disclosure of sale of shares or voting rights specified under regulation 7(1A)."
F1522238936458_S69,defendant claim,"However, SEBI has failed to do so ...It is No even the case of SEBI, that regulation 7(1A) is self operative and that the obligation there under has to be discharged independent of regulation 7(2)."
F1522238936458_S70,defendant claim,"In fact, in the impugned order, it is held by the AO that by failing to make disclosure to the stock exchanges regarding aggregate sale of shares or voting rights in excess of 2% of the share capital of the target company, the appellants are guilty of violating regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997."
F1522238936458_S71,defendant claim,"Therefore, when the Takeover Regulations, 1997 provides that the disclosure obligation specified under regulation 7(1A) has to be discharged in the manner specified under regulation 7(1A) read with regulation 7(2) and regulation 7(2) does No provide for disclosure in relation to sale of shares in excess of the limits prescribed under regulation 7(1A), SEBI is No justified in holding that the appellants by failing to make disclosure of sales covered under regulation 7(1A) within the stipulated time, have violated regulation 7(1A) read with regulation(2) of the Takeover Regulations, 1997. "
F1522238936458_S72,defendant claim,"Consequently, SEBI is no justified in imposing penalty on the appellants."""
F1522238936458_S73,defendant claim,xiv. It is submitted that the ratio of this Hon'ble Tribunal's ruling above applies to the facts of the present case as a result of which no penalty can be imposed on Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.).
F1522238936458_S74,defendant claim,xv. No benefit has accrued to Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.).
F1522238936458_S75,defendant claim,"In fact, by selling the shares prior to the positive UPSI being made public, Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) has demonstrated conduct that flies in the face of seeking to make a profit."
F1522238936458_S76,defendant claim,"xvi. There was no gain, unfair advantage or benefit has accrued to Vasparr as a result of the delayed disclosure."
F1522238936458_S77,defendant claim,"No loss has been occasioned to investors as a result of the same, and it is No even SEBI's case that interests of investors have been adversely affected. "
F1522238936458_S78,defendant claim,"Therefore, it is submitted that no penalty in respect of any alleged violation of Regulation 7(1A) of the 1997 SAST Regulations is warranted. "
F1522238936458_S79,defendant claim,Alleged violations of Regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of the 1992 PIT Regulations: xvii. It is alleged that Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) failed to disclose to VIL its Sale Transaction in violation of Regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of the PIT Regulations.

F1522238936458_S81,defendant claim,"It is an admitted fact that the Sale Transaction was notified to the exchanged and thereby the public on February 6, 2010."
F1522238936458_S82,defendant claim," xix. Therefore, it can in no way be said that the factum of the change in shareholding was No intimated by Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) to VIL."
F1522238936458_S83,defendant claim," Though the intimation did No take place in the exact form and manner prescribed by Regulation 13(3) of the 1992 PIT Regulations, it did indeed take place, albeit in another manner."
F1522238936458_S84,defendant claim,"It is submitted that such an omission was unintentional, and No with any intent to unlawfully profit from the same."
F1522238936458_S85,defendant claim," xx. The Supreme Court in Vasudev Ramchandra Shelat v. Pranlal Jayanand Thakar AIR 1974 SC 1728 has observed that: ""There is nothing in Regulation 18 to indicate that without strict compliance with some rigidly prescribed form, the transaction must fail to achieve its purpose."
F1522238936458_S86,defendant claim,"The subservience of substance of a transaction to some rigidly prescribed form required to be meticulously observed, savors of archaic and outmoded jurisprudence."""
F1522238936458_S87,defendant claim,"xxi. Admittedly, in the present case, Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) did disclose that it had sold 2.48% of its holding in VIL."
F1522238936458_S88,defendant claim,"Therefore, the form in which the disclosure is made ought to be irrelevant, where the substantive information has indeed been disclosed to the concerned parties."
F1522238936458_S89,defendant claim,"xxii. Any default in the present case was unintentional, technical and no benefits have accrued to Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.) as a result of the same."
F1522238936458_S90,defendant claim,It is respectfully submitted that no penalty ought to be imposed on Vasparr Shelter Ltd (RVL Ltd.).

SEBI (Appeal No 209 of 2011) and Ravi Mohan & Others v. SEBI (Appeal No.97 of 2014, order dated December 16, 2015), judicial discipline would require that the same ratios be followed in the present case. "
F1522238936458_S95,defendant claim,"The Hon’ble Supreme Court has in the case of Union of India and others v. Kamalakshi Finance Corporation Ltd AIR 1992 SC 711 ruled that: “It cannot be too vehemently emphasised that it is of utmost importance that, in disposing of the quasi-judicial issues before them, revenue officers are bound by the decisions of Adjudication Order in respect of Vasparr Shelter Ltd in the matter of Vas Infrastructure Ltd the appellate authorities."

F1522238936458_S98,defendant claim,The mere fact that the order of the appellate authority is No ‘’acceptable’’ to the department- in itself an objectionable phrase- and is the subject matter of an appeal can furnish no ground for No following it unless its operation has been suspended by a competent court…”

F1522238936458_S138,allegation,"Accordingly, it has been alleged that Noticee, being an insider, had sold 3,10,000 shares of VIL on February 01, 2010 while in possession of UPSI and thereby violated Regulation 3(i) and 4 of PIT Regulations, 1992. "
F1522238936458_S139,material fact,"I note that the Noticee has No disputed the facts related to the selling of the shares on February 01, 2010. "
F1522238936458_S140,material fact,The Noticee has however contended that the reason for selling the shares was that one of its group companies namely Yashraj Containeurs Ltd (YCL) was required to pay a letter of credit for repayment of charges of raw materials urgently to Bank of India (Kandivali branch).
F1522238936458_S141,material fact,"By the selling of shares, and subsequently from the proceeds of the sale transaction, an amount of Rs. 54 lacs was paid to YCL on February 04, 2010, to repay the overdue LC charges of supplier, and accordingly, YCL was able to discharge and liquidate the LC payment."

F1522238936458_S146,subjective observation,I find no evidence to the contrary based on the documents material before me.
F1522238936458_S147,defendant claim,"In support of its contentions, the Noticee has quoted the observations from the Hon’ble SAT in the decision of Mrs. Chandrakala v. SEBI (Appeal No 209 of 2011 decided on January 31, 2012) as follows - ""...The prohibition contained in regulation 3 of the regulations apply only when an insider trades or deals in securities on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information and No otherwise."
F1522238936458_S148,defendant claim, It means that the trades executed should be motivated by the information in the possession of the insider.
F1522238936458_S149,defendant claim,"If an insider trades or deals in securities of a listed company, it may be presumed that he she traded on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information in his her possession unless contrary to the same is established."
F1522238936458_S150,defendant claim,..where an entity is privy to unpublished price sensitive information it will tend to purchase shares and No sell the shares prior to the unpublished price sensitive information becoming public if the information is positive .
F1522238936458_S151,defendant claim,"A person who is in possession of unpublished price sensitive information which, on becoming public is likely to cause a positive impact on the price of the scrip, would only buy shares and would No sell the shares before the unpublished price sensitive information becomes public and would immediately offload the shares post the information becoming public. "
F1522238936458_S152,related fact,"Proceeding further, I note that the Hon’ble Securities Apellate Tribunal (SAT) in the case of Dilip S. Pendse vs. Securities and Exchange Board of India [Appeal No 80 of 2009 decided on November 19, 2009], has observed that – Adjudication Order in respect of Vasparr Shelter Ltd in the matter of Vas Infrastructure Ltd “The charge of insider trading is one of the most serious charges in relation to the securities market and having regard to the gravity of this wrong doing, higher must be the preponderance of probabilities in establishing the same."
F1522238936458_S153,related fact," In Mousam Singha Roy v. State of West Bengal (2003) 12 SCC 377, the learned judges of the Supreme Court in the context of the administration of criminal justice observed that, “It is also a settled principle of criminal jurisprudence that the more serious the offence, the stricter the degree of proof, since a higher degree of assurance is required to convict the accused.”"
F1522238936458_S154,related fact,This principle applies to civil cases as well where the charge is to be established No beyond reasonable doubt but on the preponderance of probabilities. 
F1522238936458_S155,related fact,The measure of proof in civil or criminal cases is No an absolute standard and within each standard there are degrees of probability. ..” 
F1522238936458_S156,material fact, I note that the Noticee has further contended that the unaudited quarterly results of VIL for the December 2009 quarter was positive in nature and the same is evidenced from the movement of the price of the scrip. 
F1522238936458_S157,material fact,"The Noticee has submitted that that the weighted average price of VIL was Rs. 26.25 on the day it sold the shares i.e. February 01, 2010, and subsequent to the publication of the results, the scrip had increased by more than 53% to Rs. 40.25 on February 08, 2010. "
F1522238936458_S158,material fact,"The Noticee has argued that since the UPSI was positive in nature, any insider seeking to profit from the same would buy and No sell prior to such information being made public."
F1522238936458_S159,material fact,"In this regard, I note that as per the said quarterly results that was published on February 06, 2010, as compared to a loss of Rs. 0.17 crore in the preceding quarter i.e. September 2009, VIL had recorded a profit of Rs. 0.10 crore in the quarter ended December 2009."
F1522238936458_S160,material fact,"From the price movement of VIL, I also note that there was positive price movement in the scrip subsequent to the selling by the Noticee and the publication of the quarterly results of December 2009 quarter."
F1522238936458_S161,subjective observation," In view of the above, I find merit in the contention of the Noticee that the sale transaction was contrary to the positive nature of the information. "
F1522238936458_S162,subjective observation,"Accordingly, I find that the trading pattern of the Noticee does No indicate that its Adjudication Order in respect of Vasparr Shelter Ltd in the matter of Vas Infrastructure Ltd trading was on the basis of UPSI."
F1522238936458_S163,subjective observation,"Hence, considering the facts and circumstances of the case, I am inclined to give benefit of doubt to the Noticee, especially considering the fact that the Noticee had sold prior to the positive announcement, and there was positive price movement subsequent to the publication of the quarterly results and also the Noticee’s submission that the sale transaction was inter alia for the purpose of meeting the payment liabilities of YCL. "
F1522238936458_S164,subjective observation,"Accordingly, I conclude that the alleged violation of Regulations 3(i) and 4 of PIT Regulations, 1992 by the Noticee des No stand established. "
F1522238936458_S165,material fact," From the facts and materials on record, I observe that Noticee sold 3,10,000 shares of VIL on February 01, 2010 i.e. 2.48% of the total shares of VIL. "
F1522238936458_S166,material fact,"As the sale of the aforesaid quantity of shares of VIL by the Noticee was in excess of 2% of the share capital of VIL, it required a disclosure from the Noticee within 2 days of transaction to the company as well as to the stock exchange as stipulated under regulation 7(1A) of SAST Regulations, 1997, and to the company in Form C as stipulated under Regulation 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations 1992."

F1522238936458_S171,allegation,"It was therefore alleged that the Noticee violated the provisions of regulation 7(1A) of the SAST Regulations, 1997, and Regulation 13(3) read with Regulation 13(5) of PIT Regulations 1992."
F1522238936458_S172,material fact,"I note that the Noticee vide reply dated July 23, 2016 to the SCN, has contended that the sale transactions were No required to be disclosed under Regulation 7(1A) read with 7(2) of SAST Regulations, 1997."

SEBI (Appeal No.97 of 2014, Order dated December 16, 20 15), categorically ruled that Regulation 7(1A) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations does No require disclosure of such transactions, in view of Regulation 7(2) of the 1997 Takeover Regulations."
F1522238936458_S174,statutory fact,"In this regard, I note from the SCN that the allegation against the Noticee in the present matter is the violation of Regulation 7(1A) of SAST Regulations, 1997 which states that - “Any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under sub-regulation (1) of regulation 11, shall disclose purchase or sale aggregating two per cent or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company, and the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed within two days of such purchase or sale along with the aggregate shareholding after such acquisition or sale”."
F1522238936458_S175,material fact,"From the above, I note that the aforesaid regulations specifies that both purchase and sale has to be disclosed to the company and stock exchange with two days of such purchase or sale."
F1522238936458_S176,subjective observation,"Accordingly, I find that the Noticee was required to make disclosure as stipulated under the provisions of Regulation 7(1A) of SAST Regulations, 1997."

"
F1522238936458_S178,subjective observation,"Taking into factor the minor delay viz. 1 day by the Noticee, I am inclined to take a lenient view in respect of the Noticee with regards to the alleged violation of Regulation 7(1A) of SAST Regulations, 1997."
F1522238936458_S179,defendant claim,"With regards to the disclosure under Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations, 1992, the Noticee has submitted that “Though the intimation did No take place in the exact form and manner prescribed by Regulation 13(3) of the 1992 PIT Regulations, it did indeed take place, albeit in another manner."

Pranlal Jayanand Thakar AIR 1974 SC 1728, in support of its contention that the substantive information regarding its change in the Noticee’s shareholding as regards the sale had indeed been disclosed by it."
