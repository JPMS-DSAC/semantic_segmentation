F1404444629445_S51,procedural fact,"I note that in order to establish the charge, it is necessary to prove that the noticee was an 'insider' and whether he dealt in securities when in possession of any 'unpublished price sensitive information'."
F1404444629445_S52,statutory fact,"In terms of Regulation 2(e) of the PIT Regulations, an 'insider' is any person who is or was connected with the company or is deemed to have been connected with the company."

F1404444629445_S54,subjective observation," I find that the noticee was Head, Investor Relations of SCSL during the period of investigation and being an employee of the company he was a 'connected person' and was thus an 'insider' of the company. "
F1404444629445_S55,procedural fact,"In order to decide whether the said acquisition proposal amounted to 'price sensitive information', it is imperative to look into the relevant legal provisions concerning the same."

F1404444629445_S58,subjective observation, I find that the various types of information mentioned in the above list are very wide in nature & scope and are No limited to only concrete decisions steps taken in that regard. 
F1404444629445_S59,material fact,"They are broad enough to cover within their ambit any information, related to these 7 types of information in the list, which if published is likely to materially affect the price of securities of a company, which could even be in the nature of a proposal."
F1404444629445_S60,subjective observation," I find that SCSL's announcement on December 16, 2008 about the merger of MIL & MPL with SCSL was price sensitive information."
F1404444629445_S61,material fact,This announcement resulted in a fall in the price of SCSL scrip to 151 - (33.5% fall from previous close day's closing price). 
F1404444629445_S62,material fact,"However, after the announcement of cancellation of the decision on December 17, 2008, the price recovered marginally to close at 157.10 on NSE ."

"
F1404444629445_S64,material fact,"I find that the noticee who was Head, Investor Relations at the relevant time was a key personnel at SCSL and sold a major chunk of his holdings i.e, 14,500 shares of SCSL on December 15, 2008 at around 11.30 AM."
F1404444629445_S65,material fact,"After this sale, his holding in SCSL was reduced to 3000 shares."
F1404444629445_S66,material fact," I find that the noticee had received an e- mail from SS at 7.53 PM on December 14, 2008."
F1404444629445_S67,material fact,"The subject of the said mail was ""B2: Balance sheet""."

F1404444629445_S69,material fact,"The attachment to the said mail was titled ""Acquisition of B1 & B2 by Alpha -notes.pptx."". The attachment contained draft presentation about the acquisition of two companies. "
F1404444629445_S70,material fact,"Following this mail, at around 10:09 PM, the noticee received another mail from SS with the subject ""B2: Financial Statements"" and the attachment to the said mail was titled ""Maytas Properties2008.pdf:Maytas Properties2008Auditor Report.pdf"". "
F1404444629445_S71,material fact,"This attachment contained the financials and auditors report for MPL. From all these mails, it is clear that that ""B2"" is the code for MPL."
F1404444629445_S72,material fact,"The e-mails talk about the acquisition of two companies and from the above discussion, it is clear that one of the two companies is MPL (""B2""), then it can be reasonably presumed that ""B1"" is the code for MIL. "
F1404444629445_S73,subjective observation,"Thus, I find that the noticee was aware of the acquisition of MIL and MPL by SCSL before he transacted in the shares of SCSL."
F1404444629445_S74,material fact,"Further, the e- mail sent at 7.56 PM was addressed to the noticee and a copy of the same was marked to Mr. Vadlamani Srinivas (CFO of SCSL)."

F1404444629445_S77,material fact,"As all the recipients of the said mails are key personnel senior management persons of SCSL, it is clear that the discussions on the proposed acquisition of MIL and MPL were happening for some time and the noticee was also aware of the said acquisitions."
F1404444629445_S78,subjective observation,"In view of the same, I am No in a position to accept the Adjudication order in respect of TAN Murti in the matter of SCSL contention of the Noticee that he was No aware of the proposal for acquisition of MIL & MPL by SCSL before he sold SCSL shares."
F1404444629445_S79,material fact,"Further, I find from the mobile records of the noticee that he had sent an SMS to SS at midnight i.e, 00:18:51 on December 15, 2008. SS had called the noticee at 12:36:05 hours on December 14, 2008 and at 00:19:27 hours on December 15, 2008, which lasted for about 9 minutes."
F1404444629445_S80,subjective observation,"Taking into account the mobile records and the e- mails as stated above and the subsequent transaction of the noticee on the morning of December 15, 2008 in the shares of SCSL, I find that the noticee was aware of the forthcoming acquisition deal by December 14, 2008 itself and traded when he was in possession of the said information."
F1404444629445_S81,material fact,"Being a seasoned finance professional with substantial experience in the field, there would No have been any difficulty for the noticee to anticipate the possible market reaction to the acquisition of MIL and MPL by SCSL. "
F1404444629445_S82,material fact,"In fact, SCSL’s announcement on December 16, 2008 (evening) to acquire MIL and MPL resulted in a substantial fall in share price of SCSL on December 17, 2008 when the scrip fell to a low of 151, a 33.5% fall from previous close, but after the cancellation of the decision, recovered marginally to close at 157.10 on NSE."
F1404444629445_S83,material fact,"The noticee has sold 14,500 shares of SCSL at an average price of 226 - per share on December 15, 2008 before the news of acquisition of MIL & MPL became public."
F1404444629445_S84,material fact,"The trading window that was closed on December 17, 2008 remained closed till June 12, 2009, thereby the employees could trade again only on June 15, 2009 (June 13-14,2009 being Saturday and Sunday) when the scrip of SCSL opened at . 77.40."
F1404444629445_S85,material fact," If the noticee had held on to those 14,500 shares without selling them on December 15, 2008, the noticee could have sold them off earliest on June 15, 2009 at 77.40. "
F1404444629445_S86,material fact,"As a result, the noticee has avoided losses of about .148.60 per share being the difference between the average sale price on December 15, 2008 and the price on June 15, 2009."
F1404444629445_S87,material fact,"This difference amounts to . 21, 54, 700 - for 14,500 shares."
F1404444629445_S88,subjective observation,"From the discussion above and the facts and circumstances of the case, I find that the noticee being an insider was in possession of 'unpublished price sensitive information' when he sold 14,500 shares of SCSL."
F1404444629445_S89,related fact,"Hon'ble SAT in the matter of Mrs Chandrakala vs SEBI (Appeal No 209 2011 decided on 31.01.2012) observed thus: ""..........If an insider trades or deals in securities of a listed company, it may be presumed that he she traded on the basis of unpublished price sensitive information in his her possession unless contrary to the same is established."
F1404444629445_S90,related fact," The burden of proving a situation contrary to the presumption mentioned above lies on the insider""."
F1404444629445_S91,material fact,"In this context, I have perused the reasons given by the noticee for his sale of 14,500 shares of SCSL on December 15, 2010."
F1404444629445_S92,subjective observation,I find that the noticee is very inconsistent or unstable regarding the reasons for the said sale. 
F1404444629445_S93,material fact,He has cited different reasons at different times.
F1404444629445_S94,material fact,"In his letter dated February 01, 2010 he mentioned numerous reasons such as funding for exercise of options, selling before quiet period (trading window closure), bearish outlook of investment community towards IT industry etc."
F1404444629445_S95,material fact," In his letter dated October 31, 2012, he mentions that he wanted to purchase a house at a better location and he needed money for the same."
F1404444629445_S96,material fact," However, in his letter dated November 09, 2012, he mentions about analyst reports as the reason. "
F1404444629445_S97,material fact,He has No submitted any documents which indicate that he had a pressing need of funds at that time for purchase of house. 
F1404444629445_S98,subjective observation,"In other words, the noticee has No given any convincing evidence for selling such a large quantity of shares at that point of time. "
F1404444629445_S99,material fact,"In the instant case, the noticee was an insider and he had traded while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information."
F1404444629445_S100,material fact,The noticee has contended that he was No aware that the two companies SCSL was going to acquire were MIL and MPL as the names of the companies were mentioned as B1 and B2 in the draft presentation he received from SS.
F1404444629445_S101,subjective observation,"This contention does No appear to be correct because from the e- mails received by the noticee from SS on December 14, 2008 it is clear that ""B2"" was the code for MPL. "
F1404444629445_S102,subjective observation,"The frequent conversations by the noticee with SS on December 14-15, 2008 further support the view that the noticee was aware of the information of acquisition of the two companies."
F1404444629445_S103,violation,"Thus it is clear that the noticee sold the shares of SCSL on December 15, 2010 when he was in possession of unpublished price sensitive information and has thus violated the provisions of Regulation 3(i) of PIT Regulations read with Section 12A (e) and (d) of the SEBI Act. "
F1404444629445_S104,penalty,"The aforesaid violations by the Noticee make him liable for penalty u s. 15G of the SEBI Act which reads as under: “Penalty for insider trading 15G. If any insider who,- (i) either on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person, deals in securities of a body corporate listed on any stock exchange on the basis of any unpublished price sensitive information; or (ii) communicates any unpublished price- sensitive information to any person, with or without his request for such information except as required in the ordinary course of business or under any law; or (iii) counsels, or procures for any other person to deal in any securities of any body corporate on the basis of unpublished price-sensitive information, shall be liable to a penalty of twenty-five crore rupees or three times the amount of profits made out of insider trading, whichever is higher. "
F1404444629445_S105,statutory fact,"I find that unlike the charging provision of regulation 3 (i) of PIT Regulations which prohibits trading in a scrip ‘while in possession’ of UPSI regarding the same scrip, section 15 G of SEBI Act penalises trading in a scrip ‘on the basis of’ the UPSI."
F1404444629445_S106,related fact,"For interpretation of the words ‘on the basis of’ in section 15G of SEBI Act, I rely on the interpretation of the words ‘on the basis of’ by the Hon’ble SAT in its order dated May 09, 2008 in the matter of Rajiv B Gandhi vs. SEBI (Appeal No.50 of 2007). "
