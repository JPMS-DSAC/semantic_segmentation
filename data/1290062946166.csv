F1290062946166_S44,material fact," I find from the materials available on records that the Noticee was holding 4,77,850 shares of MSFL as on March 31st , 2004 i.e. 15.93% shares of MSFL. Moreover in the reply of the Noticee dated January 08, 2008 where the Noticee had acknowledged the receipt of letters sent by investigation department, the Noticee in its para No 8 of the same had mentioned the Noticee’s Shareholding Pattern of MSFL as on December 31st, 2004 (477850 shares of MSFL) & February 28, 2005 (192350 shares of MSFL)."
F1290062946166_S45,material fact,"Thus, it is evident that prior to the sale of shares of MSFL the Noticee was holding more than 5% of the shares of the company (MSFL). "

F1290062946166_S49,material fact,"I find that with the sale of 2,90,500 shares, the Noticee crossed the limit of 2% specified in the aforesaid regulations."
F1290062946166_S50,material fact,"Further, with the said sale, the shareholding of the Noticee came down from 15.93% to 6.25% (approx)."
F1290062946166_S51,violation,"Thus, the Noticee had attracted the disclosure requirements under regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of SEBI (PIT). "
F1290062946166_S52,issues framed,The next issue for consideration is whether the Noticee had complied with the disclosure requirements under regulation 13(3) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT).
F1290062946166_S53,subjective observation,"However, I don’t find any merits in its reply & I am of the view that the ignorance of law is no excuse & it is no defence for the Noticee to state that it is very small company & has No employed adequate & qualified staff."
F1290062946166_S54,subjective observation,If it can’t employ such adequate & qualified staff then there is no need of such company which can’t comply with the statutory requirements & moreover such company should No acquire or hold shares in such huge quantities.
F1290062946166_S55,subjective observation,"Moreover, the Noticee in its reply dated March 18, 2009 had admitted that it had No made the requisite disclosure due to reasons referred above. "
F1290062946166_S56,subjective observation,"Hence, I am of the view that the Noticee had No complied with the disclosure requirements of regulations 13(3) and 13(5) of SEBI (PIT)."
F1290062946166_S57,subjective observation,"Therefore, the violation of the said provisions stands established. "
F1290062946166_S58,issues framed,"The next issue for consideration is as to whether failure on the part of the Noticee to comply with the provisions of SEBI (PIT) attracts monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, and if so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticee."
F1290062946166_S59,statutory fact,"The provisions of section 15 A (b) of SEBI Act is reproduced here under : Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under,- (a) ………………………….

F1290062946166_S60,related fact,"The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI Vs. Shri Ram Mutual Fund [2006] 68 SCL 216 (SC) inter-alia held that “once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant."
F1290062946166_S61,related fact,Once the contravention is established then the penalty is to follow”. 
F1290062946166_S62,penalty," In view of the foregoing, I am convinced that it is a fit case to impose monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act. "
F1290062946166_S63,statutory fact,"While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15A (b), I have considered the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:- “15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.” "
F1290062946166_S64,subjective observation,"From the material available on record, it may No be possible to ascertain the exact monetary loss to the investors on account of default by the Noticee. "
F1290062946166_S65,subjective observation,"The change in the shareholding of the Noticee and timely disclosure thereof, were of some importance from the point of view of outside shareholders other investors as that would have prompted them to buy or sell shares of MSFL."
F1290062946166_S66,subjective observation,"By No complying with the regulatory obligation of making the disclosure when the change in the shareholding of the Noticee exceeded 2%, it had concealed the vital information from the investors."
F1290062946166_S67,subjective observation,The object of the SEBI (PIT) mandating disclosure of acquisition sale beyond certain quantity is to give equal treatment and opportunity to all shareholders and protect their interests. 
F1290062946166_S68,subjective observation,"To translate this objective into reality, measures have been taken by SEBI to bring about transparency in the transactions and it is for this purpose that dissemination of such information is required."
F1290062946166_S69,subjective observation,The purpose of these disclosures is to bring about transparency in the transactions and assist the Regulator to effectively monitor the transactions in the market.
F1290062946166_S70,subjective observation,"It would, however, be difficult to come to a firm conclusion as to how the general shareholders would have reacted on knowing the aforesaid change in the shareholding of the Noticee. "
F1290062946166_S71,subjective observation,The Noticee could No pre-judge the reaction of the investors.
F1290062946166_S72,subjective observation,"By virtue of the failure on the part of the Noticee to make the necessary disclosure on time, the fact remains that the shareholders investors were deprived of the important information at the relevant point of time."
F1290062946166_S73,violation,"The Noticee had failed to comply with the provisions of Reg. 13(3) & 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) for two times i.e. on February 4, 2005 when the Noticee sold 1,00,000 shares of MSFL & the change in shareholding at that point of time was 3.33 % app. & therefore the Noticee was statutory obligation to disclose the sale of shares within 4 working days of the sale. "
F1290062946166_S74,violation,"Moreover, the Noticee had sold 95,500 shares of MSFL on February 7, 2005 & the change in shareholding had exceeded 2 % & therefore the Noticee was under statutory obligation to disclose the number of shares held & change in shareholding within 4 working days. "
F1290062946166_S75,subjective observation,"Thus, the nature of default committed by the Noticee can be treated as repetitive."
F1290062946166_S76,subjective observation,Had there been any investor complaint the violation would have been more serious.
F1290062946166_S77,penalty,"After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record, I hereby impose a monetary penalty of Rs. 10,00,000 - (Rupees Ten Lakhs only) on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the default committed by Noticee."
F1290062946166_S78,procedural fact,"The Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI- Penalties Remittable to Government of India”, payable at Mumbai, within 45 days of receipt of this order. "
