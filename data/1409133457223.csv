F1409133457223_S26,material fact,I find from the reply of the Noticee to the SCN that the Noticee has No disputed the allotment of shares through Rights Issue.
F1409133457223_S27,defendant claim,"The Noticee has contended that it was under an assumption that since it was a part of promoter group of SPARL, the applicable regulation for disclosure was regulation 13(4A) of PIT Regulations, 1992."

F1409133457223_S30,defendant claim,The particulars to be disclosed in Form A and Form D are almost identical and hence all the material information were available for the public at large.
F1409133457223_S31,subjective observation,I do No find merit in the contention of the Noticee.
F1409133457223_S32,related fact," In this context, I would like to rely on observation of Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) in Premchand Shah and Others V. SEBI dated February 21, 2011, wherein it was held that ""…….When a law prescribes a manner in which a thing is to be done, it must be done only in that manner.……Non-disclosure of information in the prescribed manner deprived the investing public of the information which is required to be available with them when they take informed decision while making investments………………… """
F1409133457223_S33,subjective observation,"I find that the obligation to make disclosure under regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 is independent of obligation to make disclosure under 13(4A) of PIT Regulations, 1992."
F1409133457223_S34,subjective observation,"Also, there is a separate format prescribed for disclosure under each regulation."
F1409133457223_S35,subjective observation,"If a Adjudication order in respect of M s Virtuous Share Investments Pvt Ltd in the matter of Sun Pharma Advanced Research Co. Ltd August 27, 2014 person entity triggers both the regulations, the obligation to make disclosure is under both the regulations separately. "
F1409133457223_S36,subjective observation,"Notwithstanding this, even if one were to treat the compliance under regulation 13 (4A) of PIT Regulations, 1992 as compliance under regulation 13 (1) of PIT Regulations, 1992, as claimed by the Noticee, no relief can be granted to the Noticee for its non-compliance under regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992, for the reason that even the disclosure under regulation 13 (4A) of PIT Regulations, 1992 was admittedly filed by the Noticee with a delay of more than a month. "

F1409133457223_S39,subjective observation,The contention of the Noticee is No acceptable. 
F1409133457223_S40,subjective observation,Disclosures under Listing Agreement is filed by the company and No by the promoters Noticee.
F1409133457223_S41,statutory fact,"The disclosure obligation of the Noticee under PIT Regulations, 1992 is mandatory and independent of the disclosure obligation by the company under Listing Agreement."
F1409133457223_S42,defendant claim,"The Noticee in his additional submissions has stated that it has filed the necessary disclosure under regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 in Form A on August 23, 2014, i.e. post hearing. "
F1409133457223_S43,subjective observation,It is pertinent to state that timeliness is the essence of disclosure and delayed disclosure would serve no purpose at all.
F1409133457223_S44,subjective observation,"I am of the view that when mandatory time period is stipulated for doing a particular activity, Adjudication order in respect of M s Virtuous Share Investments Pvt Ltd in the matter of Sun Pharma Advanced Research Co. Ltd August 27, 2014 completion of the same after that period would constitute default in compliance and No delay. "
F1409133457223_S45,subjective observation,"Therefore, I hold that the Noticee has violated regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992."
F1409133457223_S46,issues framed,"(b) Does the non-compliance, if any, attract monetary penalty under section 15A (b) of SEBI Act, 1992? "
F1409133457223_S47,related fact,"In this context, I would like to quote the observations of The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of Chairman, SEBI v.. Shriram Mutual Fund {[2006] 5 SCC 361} held that “In our considered opinion, penalty is attracted as soon as the contravention of the statutory obligation as contemplated by the Act and the Regulations is established and hence the intention of the parties committing such violation becomes wholly irrelevant…”. "
F1409133457223_S48,penalty,"As the violation of the statutory obligation under regulation 13(1) of PIT Regulations, 1992 has been established, I am convinced that it is a fit case for imposing monetary penalty under section 15A(b) of SEBI Act, 1992, which reads as under:- Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. "
F1409133457223_S49,penalty,"15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made there under,- (a) ........................................................... (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefore in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefore in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less."
F1409133457223_S50,issues framed,"(c) If so, what would be the monetary penalty that can be imposed taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of SEBI Act, 1992? "
F1409133457223_S51,penalty,"While determining the quantum of penalty under section 15A (b) of SEBI Act, 1992 , it is important to consider the factors stipulated in section 15J of SEBI Act, 1992, which reads as under:- “15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.” "
F1409133457223_S52,subjective observation," It is difficult, in cases of this nature, to quantify exactly the disproportionate gains or unfair advantage enjoyed by an entity and the consequent losses suffered by the investors."
F1409133457223_S53,material fact,There is no material on record which dwells on the extent of specific gains made by the Noticee by No making the specified disclosures on the due dates.
F1409133457223_S54,material fact," However, the fact remains that by No making the required disclosures, the Noticee had deprived the investors of important information at the relevant time."
F1409133457223_S55,subjective observation, It is noted that the violation is No repetitive in nature. 
F1409133457223_S56,penalty,"After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, I hereby impose a monetary penalty of 3,00,000 - (Rupees Adjudication order in respect of M s Virtuous Share Investments Pvt Ltd in the matter of Sun Pharma Advanced Research Co. Ltd August 27, 2014 Three Lakh Only) on the Noticee which will be commensurate with the violation committed by it. "
F1409133457223_S57,procedural fact,"The Noticee shall pay the said amount of penalty by way of demand draft in favour of “SEBI - Penalties Remittable to Government of India”, payable at Mumbai, within 45 days of receipt of this order. "
