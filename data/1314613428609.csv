F1314613428609_S36,allegation,"It has been alleged that the Noticee sold the shares on December 11, 2009 and the transaction was No a spot delivery contract as defined in SCR Act. "

F1314613428609_S38,defendant claim,"To this charge the submissions of the Noticee are summarized below: a. The Noticee sold 159,500 shares of GSML to Taralta on December 11, 2009 by way of an off-market transaction."
F1314613428609_S39,defendant claim,"It raised a bill of the sale consideration amounting to Rs.79,75,000 on December 11, 2009. "
F1314613428609_S40,defendant claim,"On receipt of the said bill, Taralta gave three separate cheques aggregating to a sum of Rs.79,75,000 being the consideration to the Noticee on December 11, 2009 at around 3.00 PM itself, i.e. payment for price was made on the same day the invoice was passed. "
F1314613428609_S41,defendant claim,"However, as December 12, 2009 was a Saturday and December 13, 2009 was a Sunday, the said cheques were deposited by the Noticee with its bank only on Monday, i.e., December 14, 2009 due to the intervention of these two non-clearing days. "
F1314613428609_S42,defendant claim,"Therefore, the payment of the Consideration was received by the Noticee on December 11, 2009, i.e., on the date of the sale itself and this was in accordance with Section 2(i) of the SCR Act. "
F1314613428609_S43,defendant claim,"b. To discharge its obligations towards Taralta, the Noticee gave it a duly filled and signed delivery instruction slip (“DIS”) on December 11, 2009 (“First DIS”) containing complete details of the number of shares and thus delivery was intended to be effected on the same day as the invoice itself, which was duly handed over to the representative of Taralta simultaneously. "
F1314613428609_S44,defendant claim,"Taralta did No provide the spaces for such details regarding its demat account to the Noticee, the corresponding spaces of such details were left blank in the First DIS. "
F1314613428609_S45,defendant claim,"c. Therefore, upon execution of the First DIS coupled with the delivery of the same, the Noticee had no control over the said shares and the equitable ownership of the said shares passed onto the buyer, i.e. Taralta. "
F1314613428609_S46,defendant claim,"On January 6, 2010, a representative of Taralta approached the Noticee and informed it that Taralta wanted to perfect its equitable title to the shares by making it a legal title, enabling to be included in the Register of Members of GSML, which it had No been able to do as yet as Taralta did No have a demat account on December 11, 2009 and its demat account was opened only on January 5, 2010. "
F1314613428609_S47,defendant claim,"On request of the said representative of Taralta, the details of Taralta’s account were filled in the First DIS. "
F1314613428609_S48,defendant claim,"However, the Noticee was advised that as the demat account of Taralta did No exist on the date on which the First DIS was executed. "
F1314613428609_S49,defendant claim,"Therefore, the First DIS was cancelled and a fresh DIS dated January 6, 2010, the same day as the request was made, was issued by the Noticee after the demat account of Taralta was opened on January 5, 2010."
F1314613428609_S50,defendant claim,"The shares were credited in Taralta’s demat account on January 6, 2010."
F1314613428609_S51,defendant claim,"Thus, the fresh DIS was only executed to enable Taralta to perfect its legal title, which it was prevented from doing solely on account of it No having a demat account, i.e. No on account of any intervention or control over the shares by the Noticee, but merely because the shares were in demat form. "
F1314613428609_S52,defendant claim,"d. In case of sale of shares in demat form, only constructive equitable possession of shares can be given to the purchaser through a duly signed DIS. "
F1314613428609_S53,defendant claim,"The said sale of shares was a genuine and bonafide commercial transaction and was No done with intent of undesirable speculation and the same was in consonance with the spirit and object of SCR Act and S.13 & 16 of SCR Act. By virtue of S.18 of SCA Act, S.13 does No apply to spot delivery contract. "
F1314613428609_S54,material fact,"I find that the Noticee sold 1,59,500 shares to TCPL through off market on December 11, 2009. "
F1314613428609_S55,material fact,The Noticee raised the bill for the said sale on the same date and the Noticee received the payment by way of cheques from TCPL on the same day itself. 
F1314613428609_S56,material fact,"December 12 and 13, 2009 being Saturday and Sunday, the cheques were cleared on Monday i.e. the next working day and the Noticee therefore received the payment on December 14, 2009. "
F1314613428609_S57,material fact,"The Noticee had handed over the delivery instruction slip (DIS) for the transfer of 1,59,500 shares to the TCPL simultaneously."
F1314613428609_S58,material fact,"As TCPL was No having the demat account at that point of time, the transfer of shares from the Noticee’s demat account to TCPL demat account could No have taken place. "
F1314613428609_S59,material fact,"TCPL opened the demat account on January 05, 2010 and thereafter the delivery of shares took place on January 06, 2010. "
F1314613428609_S60,subjective observation,"By delivering the DIS and receiving the consideration for the said sale, the Noticee fulfilled its obligation and the delay in transfer was just technical in nature rather than intentional. "
F1314613428609_S61,subjective observation,The delay in transfer of beneficial ownership of the shares was beyond the control of the Noticee which is more of technical in nature rather than intentional. 
F1314613428609_S62,material fact," It is pertinent to mention here that when the securities are dealt in the physical mode, the seller make delivery of the securities by signing a blank transfer deed and the actual transfer of title takes place later. "
F1314613428609_S63,material fact,In the demat mode the delivery of securities is said to be completed when the depository effect the transfer of beneficial ownership from the seller to the buyer. 
F1314613428609_S64,subjective observation,"In the present case, for the reasons cited above the actual transfer of beneficial ownership didn’t take place within the prescribed time period and therefore, the transaction may No be technically fit into the definition of spot delivery contract. "
F1314613428609_S65,material fact,"However, one needs to consider the purpose of Sections 13 and 16 read with 18 of SCR Act. "
F1314613428609_S66,material fact, I find that the Noticee received payment of the consideration immediately on execution of the transaction and delivered the DIS to the buyer. 
F1314613428609_S67,material fact,The intention of the parties was clear at the time of the execution of the transaction and constructive equitable possession of the shares was given to TCPL.
F1314613428609_S68,subjective observation, I am of the view that the transactions are bonafide and delivery based genuine commercial transaction and was No done with the intent of any undesirable speculation and therefore the transaction was in consonance with the spirit and object of SCR Act and Sections 13 and 16.
F1314613428609_S69,subjective observation," In view of the same, I am inclined to give benefit of doubt to the Noticee and do No hold it guilty of violation of Sections 13, 16 read with 18 of SCR Act. "
F1314613428609_S70,issues framed,"The next issue for consideration is whether the Noticee was liable to make disclosure for the sale of 1,60,500 shares made during February 4-11, 2010 under Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations. "
F1314613428609_S71,defendant claim,To this charge the submissions of the Noticee are summarized below: a. “The Noticee and GSML were part of K.K Birla group and on his demise the shareholding of the group companies devolved unto three daughters and disentangling of the cross holding begun. 
F1314613428609_S72,defendant claim,The Noticee started as a member of K.K Birla group and is No controlled by the Nopany group.
F1314613428609_S73,defendant claim," The GSML belonged to Poddar group and for removal of cross holdings, 1,60,000 shares held by the Noticee in GSML were transferred to the members of Poddar group. "
F1314613428609_S74,defendant claim,"Regulation 13(3) sets up a two-prolonged test; to require a disclosure, the shareholder needs to hold more than 5% of the shareholding of the company, and the quantum of change in shareholding needs to exceed 2%. "
F1314613428609_S75,defendant claim,"Further, since the principle of the regulation is that of continual disclosure, each separate transfer or change in shareholding needs to be tested against the two prongs of the regulation."
F1314613428609_S76,defendant claim,"b. The two prong test was met on December 11, 2009 as the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML was greater than 5% and the quantum of change in shareholding was also greater than 2% and accordingly, a disclosure under Regulation 13(3) was made, and a matching disclosure was made under Regulation 13(6) by GSML. At no point in time subsequently were both prongs of the test met, and therefore, no requirement to make any disclosure arose under the PIT Regulations."
F1314613428609_S77,defendant claim,"After February 9, 2010, neither prong of the test was being met, No so did and therefore no question of disclosure arise."
F1314613428609_S78,defendant claim,"c. On February 04, 2010 and February 5, 2010, while the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML was greater than 5%, the quantum of shares transferred to various unrelated purchasers was 400 shares, which was a negligible quantity. "
F1314613428609_S79,defendant claim,"Therefore, as the quantum of shares which were transferred was less than 2%, in each sale, or even together, the provision of the Regulation requiring disclosure was No triggered, and therefore, there was no requirement for any disclosure to be made, under Regulation 13(3) of the PIT Regulations or even otherwise. "
F1314613428609_S80,defendant claim,"Accordingly, no such disclosure beyond that warranted in law was made by the Noticee. "
F1314613428609_S81,defendant claim,"d. On February 5, 2010, post that transfer of aforesaid 400 shares, the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML was reduced to just 5%. "
F1314613428609_S82,defendant claim,"From this point onwards, no disclosure in the terms of Regulation 13(3) was required, as the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML was No more than 5%, by the PIT Regulations for triggering the disclosure requirement. "
F1314613428609_S83,defendant claim,"Thus, even if the entire 5% stake had been sold subsequently, no requirement for any disclosure would arise. "
F1314613428609_S84,defendant claim,"e. By a transfer on February 9, 2010 of 19,500 shares of GSML to Indrakshi, amounting to 0.61% of the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML fell to 140,500 shares or 4.39%, i.e. less than 5%."
F1314613428609_S85,defendant claim,This transfer did No attract the provisions of the Regulations as the quantum of shares held was No more than 5% as required by the PIT Regulations and was also less than 2% of the shareholding of GSML. 
F1314613428609_S86,defendant claim,"f. From February 9, 2010, onwards, the transfers from UPTCL to the Purchasers were all for a quantum of less than 2% of the shareholding in GSML, individually. "
F1314613428609_S87,defendant claim,"Further, as the shareholding of the Noticee in GSML had fallen to a level which was No more than 5% on February 8, 2010, the provisions of the PIT Regulations could No have been attracted, in relation to any transaction subsequent to that date. "
F1314613428609_S88,material fact," I find that as on December 15, 2006 the Noticee held 3,20,000 shares constituting 10% of the shares capital of GSML. "
F1314613428609_S89,material fact,"Out of the said holding, Noticee on December 11, 2009 sold transferred through off market 1,59,500 shares to one TCPL which constituted 4.98%. "
F1314613428609_S90,material fact,The Noticee’s holding thus reduced to 5.02% and the Noticee as required under Insider Trading Regulations made the disclosure of same. 
F1314613428609_S91,material fact,"Thereafter, the Noticee during February 04-11, 2011 sold 1,60,500 shares in market in aid of family settlement. "
F1314613428609_S92,defendant claim,"The Noticee at the time of personal hearing argued that it sold 1,60,500 shares in smaller lots with none of them exceeding 2 % and therefore Regulation 13(3) of PIT Regulation is No attracted. "
F1314613428609_S93,subjective observation,This argument of the Noticee is No at all acceptable to me.
F1314613428609_S94,subjective observation,The sales made by the Noticee have to be reckoned from the date of the last disclosure for the purpose of Regulation 13(3). 
F1314613428609_S95,material fact,"The Noticee was holding 5.02% of the shareholding of GSML as on December 11, 2009. "
F1314613428609_S96,statutory fact,The Noticee is therefore legally required to disclose under Regulation 13(3) as and when the cumulative sales exceed 2% of its shareholding. 
F1314613428609_S97,material fact,"The Noticee crossed the limit of 2% on February 09, 2010 when the shareholding by the Noticee fell down to 1.89% of the paid-up capital; of GSML. "
F1314613428609_S98,violation,"The Noticee however, did No make the disclosure as required under Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations. "
F1314613428609_S99,material fact,The requirement of the disclosure under PIT Regulation is to bring transparency in the securities marker and greater dissemination of information to the investors regarding substantial sale of shares by an entity.
F1314613428609_S100,subjective observation," In view of the foregoing, it is established beyond doubt that the Noticee failed to make disclosures as required under Regulation 13(3) read with 13(5) of PIT Regulations and therefore violated the said provisions of PIT Regulations which warrants imposition of monetary penalty under S.15A(b) of SEBI Act. "
F1314613428609_S101,related fact,"The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in the matter of SEBI .. v s…Shri Ram Mutual Fund (2006) 68SCL 216 (SC) held - “once the violation of statutory regulations is established, imposition of penalty becomes sine qua No of violation and the intention of parties committing such violation becomes totally irrelevant. "
F1314613428609_S102,related fact,"Once the contravention is established, then the penalty is to follow”. "
F1314613428609_S103,penalty,"Thus, the aforesaid violations by the Noticee make it liable for penalty u s. 15A(b) of SEBI Act, 1992 which reads as follows: Penalty for failure to furnish information, return, etc. 15A. If any person, who is required under this Act or any rules or regulations made thereunder,— (a) …. (b) to file any return or furnish any information, books or other documents within the time specified therefor in the regulations, fails to file return or furnish the same within the time specified therefor in the regulations, he shall be liable to a penalty of one lakh rupees for each day during which such failure continues or one crore rupees, whichever is less; "
F1314613428609_S104,statutory fact,"While determining the quantum of penalty u s. 15A(b), it is important to consider the factors stipulated in S.15J of SEBI Act, which reads as under:- Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer. 15J. While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely :— (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as a result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default. "
F1314613428609_S105,subjective observation,"From the material available on record, it is No possible to ascertain the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the Noticee or the loss caused to the investors. "
