F1290154724736_NEG_S63,material fact,"Similarly, I find that in case of other clients as well, payments have been received by the Noticee for the purchases made by them."

F1290154724736_NEG_S65,subjective observation,"In view of the foregoing, I find merit in the submissions of the Noticee and I am of the view that the Noticee does No fall within the ambit of the term ‘acquirer’ as defined in regulation 2(1)(b) of SAST. "
F1290154724736_NEG_S66,subjective observation,"On the other hand, the clients who have purchased these shares are the actual acquirers."
F1290154724736_NEG_S67,subjective observation," Consequently, compliance with provisions of regulation 7(1) read with 7(2) did No arise. "
F1290154724736_NEG_S68,subjective observation,"Therefore, when regulation 7(1) was No attracted, the question of its violation cannot arise."

F1290154724736_NEG_S71,subjective observation,The term ‘acquisition’ has No been defined either under PIT or SAST. 
F1290154724736_NEG_S72,related fact,"Black’s Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, defines the term ‘Acquisition’ as ”the gaining of possession or control over something <acquisition of target company’s assets> 0r something acquired”. "
F1290154724736_NEG_S73,subjective observation,"Thus, the primary requirement for acquisition is to acquire something, thereby making the person an “acquirer” as defined under SAST. "
F1290154724736_NEG_S74,subjective observation,"However, as mentioned above, the Noticee does No fall within the ambit of the term “Acquirer” as defined under SAST and therefore, it cannot be said to have acquired the shares."
F1290154724736_NEG_S75,subjective observation,"Accordingly, there was no acquisition by the Noticee which needed to be disclosed under regulation 13(1) of PIT."
F1290154724736_NEG_S76,subjective observation,"Be that as it may, it is pertinent to highlight the failure on the part of the Noticee to transfer the shares to the respective Beneficiary Owner accounts of clients for whom the Noticee had purchased the shares."
F1290154724736_NEG_S77,subjective observation,This failure practice enabled the true owners of the shares to hide their identity behind the Noticee. 
F1290154724736_NEG_S78,subjective observation,"This would encourage the clients to acquire shares through differrent brokers and even if their total acquisition exceeds the limits specified under PIT and SAST, they may No be disclosing the same as they have found a convenient mask to hide their real identity behind the brokers. "
F1290154724736_NEG_S79,subjective observation,"The said market practice, if No checked and nipped in the bud, may snowball into an appalling strategy in the hands of unscrupulous elements affecting the smooth functioning of the securities market and jeopardizing the interest of investors. "
