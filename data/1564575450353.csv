F1564575450353_S66,issues framed,"If so, what would be the quantum of monetary penalty that can be imposed on the Noticees after taking into consideration the factors mentioned in section 15J of the SEBI Act?"
F1564575450353_S67,statutory fact,"Before proceeding further, I would like to refer to the relevant provisions of the Stock Brokers Regulations, alleged to have been violated by IIFL, as below: Stock Broker Regulations SCHEDULE II CODE OF CONDUCT FOR STOCK BROKERS A. General (2) Exercise of due skill and care: A stock-broker shall act with due skill, care anddiligence in the conduct of all his business."
F1564575450353_S68,issues framed,"Whether IIFL accepted orders in the trading account of its client viz. Ms. Vimala from Ms. Sapna Saraogi without obtaining proper authorization & only on the basis of verbal instructions, thereby, violating provisions of Clause A(2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II r w Regulation 7 of Stock Brokers Regulations."
F1564575450353_S69,allegation,"I note that the allegation against IIFL is regarding the trading done in the account of one of its client viz. Ms. Vimala by her daughter, Ms. Sapna"
F1564575450353_S70,defendant claim,IIFL has submitted that it had received oral instruction from Ms. Vimala to allow Ms. Sapna and Mr. Atul to place orders on her behalf for trading in her account and it is only in good Adjudication Order in the matter of Saint-Gobain Sekurit India Ltd faith that IIFL accepted orders from Ms. Sapna to execute trades in the account of Ms. Vimala.
F1564575450353_S71,defendant claim,"In this regard, IIFL has also stated that the orders received from Ms. Sapna on behalf of Ms. Vimala were in the normal course of business and there appeared no reason for IIFL to doubt the intention in the placement of orders by Ms. Sapna on behalf of Smt. Vimala."
F1564575450353_S72,defendant claim,"In this regard, all trade related communications, trade confirmation, contract notes, bills were duly sent to her registered email id and also SMS intimating trade details was sent to her registered mobile number."
F1564575450353_S73,defendant claim,"Further, it may be noted that at no point of time, Ms. Vimala had disputed trades done in her account and also duly met her required margin pay-in obligations in respect of her trades"
F1564575450353_S74,material fact,"I note from the material available on record that the fact that during the Investigation period, the instructions to trade in the scrip of SGSIL, in the account of Ms. Vimala were being given by Sapna Saraogi and the account was managed by Ms. Sapna and Mr. Atul is an admitted fact by IIFL"
F1564575450353_S75,issues framed,"Therefore, the only issue to deliberate in this matter is whether proper authorisation was available with IIFL to accept instructions from Ms. Sapna to trade in the account of Ms. Vimala."
F1564575450353_S76,material fact,I note from the Investigation report and the SCN issued to IIFL that the KYC form and the Account opening form of Ms. Vimala does No mention the names of Ms. Sapna or Mr. Atul
F1564575450353_S77,material fact,Ms. Vimala was the sole signatory to her account
F1564575450353_S78,material fact,I note that the Investigation report also mentions that clause 20 of the Member Client agreement between IIFL and Ms. Vimala states that a written authorization letter is required to be obtained by the broker from the client to allow any other person to trade in the client’s account.
F1564575450353_S79,subjective observation,"In this regard, I am No in agreement with the contention of IIFL that Oral instruction of Ms. Vimala was sufficient authorization for IIFL to accept orders in the account of Ms. Vimala from Ms. Sapna"
F1564575450353_S80,subjective observation,"As noted above, the member client agreement of Ms. Vimala with IIFL clearly mentions that a written authorization letter is required to authorize another person to trade in the account of Ms. Vimala."
F1564575450353_S81,subjective observation,Thus it is clear that there was a specific requirement of obtaining written authorization from the client (Ms. Vimala) in order to authorize another person to deal in the client’s account.
F1564575450353_S82,subjective observation,"Once there is a specific mention Adjudication Order in the matter of Saint-Gobain Sekurit India Ltd about the terms for the agreement between a member and its client, there cannot be any overriding verbal understanding instruction between the client and IIFL"
F1564575450353_S83,subjective observation,"As a prudent Stock broker who is expected to deal on behalf of its clients with utmost skill, care and diligence, IIFL should have ensured obtaining written authorization from its client Ms. Vimala for allowing her daughter Ms. Sapna to deal in her account and No relied on a mere oral instruction."
F1564575450353_S84,related fact,The model member client agreement has been issued by SEBI in conformity with the requirements of the regulations relating to the conduct of stock brokers and accordingly has got a statutory force and so the brokers are bound to abide by the requirements.
F1564575450353_S85,subjective observation,"In this regard, the fact is admitted by IIFL that it had No obtained any written authorization letter from Ms. Vimala and IIFL had allowed Ms. Sapna to trade in the account of Ms. Vimala only on the basis of her oral instructions"
F1564575450353_S86,violation,"Therefore, I conclude that by accepting orders from Ms. Sapna for trading in the account of Ms. Vimala in the scrip of SGSIL, IIFL has breached the terms of the member-client agreement and therefore IIFL has failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence in the conduct of its business in violation of provisions of Clause A (2) of the Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers as specified under Schedule II r w Regulation 7 of Stock Brokers Regulations."
F1564575450353_S87,related fact,It is necessary that registered intermediaries follow the various procedures and practices prescribed for smooth and transparent functioning of the securities market
F1564575450353_S88,related fact,"As a registered stock broker, the Noticee was expected to act diligently and comply with all the statutory requirements of law"
F1564575450353_S89,related fact,A stock broker is expected to play the role of a gatekeeper and No conduct its business in a mechanical manner and flout the various provisions of law prescribed by the Regulator from time to time
F1564575450353_S90,subjective observation,"Going by the submission of the Noticee that it had obtained oral instructions from the client, in my view, Noticee still acted in a callous manner by allowing other persons to trade in its client’s account without proper authorisation."
F1564575450353_S91,subjective observation,Such lapse on the part of the Noticee is a serious violation and shows lack of due diligence and care undertaken by the Noticee
F1564575450353_S92,subjective observation,"The irregularities committed by the Noticee, gist of which has been mentioned above, are serious in nature, and cannot be viewed leniently"
F1564575450353_S93,defendant claim,"I note that one of the contentions raised by IIFL is that the principle of res judicata is applicable in the instant matter as they were imposed with penalty Adjudication Order in the matter of Saint-Gobain Sekurit India Ltd for the same violation, but in a different scrip"
F1564575450353_S94,defendant claim,"In this regard, I note that vide Adjudication Order dated February 23, 2018, a penalty of 2,00,000 was imposed on IIFL for accepting orders in the account of Ms. Vimala from Mr. Atul for trading in the scrip of United Spirits Ltd"
F1564575450353_S95,subjective observation,"In this regard, I note that the cause of action in both the matters are No the same"
F1564575450353_S96,subjective observation,The previous Adjudication proceedings were with respect to the trading done in the scrip of United Spirits Ltd for which the instructions were given by Mr. Atul whereas the current proceedings are for the trading done in the scrip of SGSIL for which instructions were given by Ms. Sapna.
F1564575450353_S97,subjective observation,"Further, the period of investigation for which violations have been alleged are also different in both the SCNs"
