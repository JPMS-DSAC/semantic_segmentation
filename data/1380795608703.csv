F1380795608703_S65,material fact,The Noticee in his reply and during personal hearing put forward various contentions and it was emphasized that the Noticee did No attend the Board meetings in which the issue was considered.
F1380795608703_S66,material fact,"I note that the Noticee was admittedly Non-Executive Independent Director of the Company during the period August 25, 2004 to April 28, 2011."
F1380795608703_S67,material fact,"The Board of Suzlon, after granting approval for drafting a new code of conduct, was supposed to discuss it in the meeting held on May 29, 2010. "
F1380795608703_S68,subjective observation,"The time period between authorization for drafting a new code and discussing it is nearly 10 months, which appears to be excessive."
F1380795608703_S69,material fact,"However, the new code of conduct could No be discussed by the Board on May 29, 2010 and it was kept in Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 abeyance. "
F1380795608703_S70,material fact,"The said draft was supposed to be considered again in the meeting dated August 13, 2010, but even in this meeting the issue could No be discussed."

F1380795608703_S72,procedural fact," I have perused the papers relating to the Board of directors of Suzlon at the time of relevant Board meetings i.e. from November 19, 2008 till February 4, 2011."
F1380795608703_S73,material fact,I note that the Noticee's name figured in the list of the Board of Directors of Suzlon in all the four relevant meetings when the issue of change in the code of conduct was to be discussed. 
F1380795608703_S74,material fact,"However, it is observed from the details of Board meeting attendance provided by Suzlon that the Noticee did No attend these four Board meetings. "
F1380795608703_S75,related fact,"The Hon'ble Securities Appellate Tribunal in the case of N. Narayanan v. The Adjudicating Officer, SEBI (Appeal No 29 of 2012 decided on October 5, 2012) while commenting on the role of directors, had observed that ""With the changing scenario in the corporate world the concept of corporate responsibilities is also rapidly changing day by day."
F1380795608703_S76,related fact,The director of a company cannot confine himself to lending his name to the company but taking light responsibility for its day to day management. 
F1380795608703_S77,related fact,"While functions may be delegated to professionals, the duty of care, diligence, verification of critical points by directors cannot be abdicated."
F1380795608703_S78,related fact," The directors are expected to have a hands on approach in the running of the company and take up responsibility No only for the achievements of the company but also the failings thereto."""
F1380795608703_S79,subjective observation,Thus the role of director and the responsibilities attached to that position in a listed company cannot be underestimated.
F1380795608703_S80,subjective observation," Even though Adjudication Order in respect of Pradip Kumar Khaitan in the matter of Suzlon Energy Limited September 30, 2013 the Noticee was a Non-executive Independent Director of the Company and No involved in day to day management, it was expected from him to oversee the functioning of the company. "
F1380795608703_S81,subjective observation,"As the Noticee was No present in any of the four Board Meetings dealing with the issue of change in the code of conduct, it would be difficult for the Noticee to monitor this issue."
F1380795608703_S82,subjective observation," Although the entire Board of the company is responsible for the delay of over 2 years in the implementation of the code of conduct, it would be difficult to attribute the said delay on the Noticee."
F1380795608703_S83,subjective observation,"Thus, I am of the opinion that the Noticee can be given benefit of doubt for the delay caused in implementation of code of conduct by Suzlon."
F1380795608703_S84,subjective observation," In view of the above observations, findings and material on record I conclude that the allegation of violation of Clause 1.2 of Model code of Conduct in Part A, Schedule I provided under Regulation 12(1) of the PIT Regulations by the Noticee is No proved."
F1380795608703_S85,subjective observation,"In view of the foregoing, the alleged violation of the provisions of PIT Regulations by the Noticee, as specified in the SCN dated June 19, 2012 does No stand established and the matter is, accordingly, disposed of."
F1380795608703_S86,procedural fact,"In terms of the Rule 6 of the Adjudicating Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to Securities and Exchange Board of India."
