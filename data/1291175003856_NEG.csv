F1291175003856_NEG_S50,subjective observation,"Thus, if there is no requirement of a public announcement, Regulation 3 is No at all attracted and there is no question of imposition of any penalty.” "
F1291175003856_NEG_S51,subjective observation," In the light of the above, I am of the view that regulation 3 will come into play only if any of the substantive clauses, i.e. regulations 10, 11 or 12 of the SAST is are first attracted."
F1291175003856_NEG_S52,subjective observation," Further, on a careful reading of regulation 3(3) of SAST, I find that acquisitions falling under regulations 3(1)(e), (h) and (i) of SAST needs to be notified by the acquirer to the stock exchanges in case the acquisition exceeds 5% of the voting capital of the company."
F1291175003856_NEG_S53,material fact," Though, in the instant case, the acquisition exceeded 5%, there is nothing on record to show that the Noticee had sought exemption from the applicability of the provisions of regulation 11(1) under regulation 3 of SAST. "

F1291175003856_NEG_S55,subjective observation,"When regulation 3(3) does No apply, the question of its violation cannot arise."

"
F1291175003856_NEG_S59,subjective observation,"I am of the view that the provisions of the regulation 7(1) of SAST would be attracted by a person or a group of persons acting in concert, when overall post–acquisition holding crosses 5% or 10% or 14% or 54% or 74%."
F1291175003856_NEG_S60,related fact,The SAST made under SEBI Act was framed basically taking into consideration the recommendations of the committee chaired by Justice (retd.) P N Bhagwati.
F1291175003856_NEG_S61,related fact,It is necessary to go behind the regulatory requirements to discover their raison de etre and the fundamental principles on which these regulations are predicated.
F1291175003856_NEG_S62,related fact,"It will be appropriate to refer to the recommendation of the committee with regard to disclosure requirements as stated in para 15 of Justice P.N. Bhagwati Committee Report on Takeovers dated May 7, 2002."

F1291175003856_NEG_S65,statutory fact,"Accordingly, regulation 7(1A) as existed in 2006 reads as under: 7(1A) Any acquirer who has acquired shares or voting rights of a company under sub-regulation (1) of regulation 11, shall disclose purchase or sale aggregating two per cent or more of the share capital of the target company to the target company, and the stock exchanges where shares of the target company are listed within two days of such purchase or sale along with the aggregate shareholding after such acquisition or sale. "
F1291175003856_NEG_S66,material fact,"On perusal of the documents available on record, it is observed that the individual shareholding of the Noticee was 22.84% and the collective shareholding of the promoter group was 40.6% as at the quarter ended March 2006. "
F1291175003856_NEG_S67,subjective observation,"Since the Noticee, individually as well as collectively, held more than 15% but less than 55% as of June 27, 2006, i.e. one day prior to the date of acquisition of 11,12,000 shares representing 7.4% of the voting capital of TBL, I am of the view that the said acquisition made by the Noticee attracted the provisions of regulation 7(1A) and No regulation 7(1) as alleged."
F1291175003856_NEG_S68,subjective observation,"When regulation 7(1) does No apply, the question of its violation cannot arise. "
F1291175003856_NEG_S69,subjective observation,"In the light of the aforesaid findings, I conclude that out of the three allegations made against the Noticee, only violation of regulation 13(4) read with regulation 13(5) of SEBI (PIT) is established, i.e. because of delay in disclosure by one day. "
F1291175003856_NEG_S70,subjective observation,There is nothing on record to show that the aforesaid one day delay in making the disclosure resulted in any disproportionate gain or unfair advantage to the Noticee or any loss to an investor or group of investors. 
F1291175003856_NEG_S71,subjective observation,There is also nothing on record to show that the Noticee had a past record of default.
F1291175003856_NEG_S72,subjective observation,"After taking into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case and material available on record and on exercise of the judicial discretion, I am of the view that it is No a fit case to impose any monetary penalty on the Noticee and the matter is, accordingly, disposed of."
F1291175003856_NEG_S73,procedural fact," In terms of Rule 6 of the Adjudication Rules, copies of this order are sent to the Noticee and also to the Securities and Exchange Board of India."
