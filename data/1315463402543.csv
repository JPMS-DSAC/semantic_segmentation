F1315463402543_S51,defendant claim,"b. By accepting the appointment of N.M Raiji and Co. as valuers, no final decision is taken on amalgamation of GSML with ZIL. "
F1315463402543_S52,defendant claim,Everything was at the proposal stage and contingent upon the swap ratio. 
F1315463402543_S53,defendant claim,Mere consideration without any finality in a matter is No price sensitive information.
F1315463402543_S54,defendant claim,"c. In so far as swap ratio and valuation report are concerned, ZIL was coordinating with N.M. Raiji & Co. and GSML had no direct interface with it. N.M. Raiji & Co. has No sent the report to GSML as alleged. "
F1315463402543_S55,defendant claim,"The company secretary of GSML received the sealed cover containing the valuation report and the swap ratio from the Company Secretary of ZIL only on February 19, 2010."
F1315463402543_S56,defendant claim,The Company Secretary of ZIL had received two separate covers from N.M. Raiji & Co. containing the valuation report and the swap ratio.
F1315463402543_S57,defendant claim,"The sealed cover containing the report was opened at the Board Meeting held on February 22, 2010 in the presence of BOD of GSML."
F1315463402543_S58,defendant claim," If at all, there was any unpublished price sensitive information, the same came into existence on February 22, 2010."
F1315463402543_S59,defendant claim,Mere consideration of a proposal of amalgamation cannot be construed as unpublished price sensitive information.
F1315463402543_S60,defendant claim,"Therefore, there is no violation of provisions of Regulation 3(i) of PIT Regulation as alleged."
F1315463402543_S61,defendant claim,"d. Simply because there is some overlap in two independent activities (purchases made by Purchasers and proposal of amalgamation), it should No be automatically concluded that purchases were motivated by alleged unpublished price sensitive information and the Noticees had indulged in insider trading completely ignoring and overlooking the surrounding circumstances and the rationale for purchases."
F1315463402543_S62,defendant claim," Any person, who indulges in insider trading, indulges in the same with the motive of making profits by taking a contra position immediately when the information comes within the public domain."
F1315463402543_S63,defendant claim," In the matter under reference, no sales have been carried out post the alleged information becoming public. "
F1315463402543_S64,defendant claim,"On the contrary, the Noticees still continue to hold the entire shares of GSML. "
F1315463402543_S65,defendant claim,"Further, it is also unthinkable that the Noticees would indulge in insider trading, as alleged, in order to fleece their own relatives (Nophany’s) or the entities controlled by them (viz; Nopany Group) or their own group entities (Texmaco- Poddar group) and thereby deprive them of profit or pass on an avoidable loss to them. "
F1315463402543_S66,defendant claim,Same completely destroys the allegation of insider trading. 
F1315463402543_S67,subjective observation," I find that the proposed amalgamation of GSML with ZIL was at the proposal stage and it became public on February 22, 2010 on which date the BoD of both the companies decided on the amalgamation and swap ratio. Mere acceptance of the appointment of the valuer does No construed as a final word on the proposed amalgamation."
F1315463402543_S68,subjective observation," Even though the Noticees were impending the amalgamation of GSML with ZIL, there were other procedures which were required to be followed under the Companies Act and till then the amalgamation may No fructify. "
F1315463402543_S69,subjective observation,"I find that N.M.Raiji & Co. sent the valuation report to GSML and ZIL in a sealed cover and was opened at the Board Meeting on February 22, 2010."
F1315463402543_S70,subjective observation,I do No find any substantive corroborative evidences on record to counter the submissions of the Noticees and to establish that the sealed cover was opened before the Board Meeting or the Noticees were aware about the contents of the valuation report prior to its opening at the meeting of BoD. 
F1315463402543_S71,subjective observation,"Further, I find that the motive of the Noticees in purchasing the shares from UPTCL is purely separation of family business from Nopany Group which owned UPTCL. "
F1315463402543_S72,subjective observation,"The purchase of 3,20,000 shares from Texmaco Ltd was inter- se transfer among the promoter group and there are no reasons to suspect that the seller is unaware of the proposed amalgamation."
F1315463402543_S73,material fact, I have noted that the scrip of GSML is illiquid scrip and have very rarely traded since 1995. 
F1315463402543_S74,material fact,The Noticees still continue to hold the shares of GSML.
F1315463402543_S75,subjective observation,This all suggest that the Noticees traded i.e. purchased shares of GSML pursuant to the separation of business interest (family arrangement). 
F1315463402543_S76,material fact," I also find from the documents available on record that similar transactions were executed by Mrs. Shradha Agarwala who is the sister of Mr. Akshay Poddar, a deemed connected person."
F1315463402543_S77,material fact,Poddar group companies’ viz. M s Greenland Trading Pvt Ltd and Indrakshi Trading Company Ltd which were also deemed connected persons traded in the shares of GSML during the relevant period.
F1315463402543_S78,subjective observation,The trades of the above entities were treated as executed pursuant to the separation of business interest (family arrangement) and the motives behind their trading were No to gain any unfair advantage and accordingly No in violation of the provisions of the Insider Trading Regulations. 
F1315463402543_S79,subjective observation,"Similarly, ZIL and its subsidiary Zuari Investments Ltd executed transactions in the shares of GSML during the relevant period but concluded that the trades were No carried out to gain any unfair advantage and accordingly No considered in violations of Insider Trading Regulations. "
F1315463402543_S80,subjective observation, I find that there are no sufficient evidences available on record to prove that the trades were carried out by the Noticees to gain any unfair advantage but on the contrary those were executed in the aid of family arrangement and inter-se transfer amongst the group in similar lines as mentioned in para above. 
F1315463402543_S81,subjective observation,"I am thereofore, inclined to give benefit of doubt to the Noticees and conclude that the allegations of trading in shares of GSML while in possession of unpublished price sensitive information in contravention of Regulations 3(i) and 4 of Insider Trading Regulations do No stand established. "
F1315463402543_S82,procedural fact,The next issue for consideration is whether Mr. Akshay Poddar had failed to make a disclosure as required under Regulation 7(1) of SAST Regulations. 
F1315463402543_S83,material fact,Investigation revealed that Mr. Akshay Poddar was holding 80000 shares (2.5%) of GSML at the end of December 2009.
F1315463402543_S84,material fact,His shareholding increased to 235000 shares constituting 7.34% of the share capital of GSML at the end of March 2010. 
F1315463402543_S85,material fact,"Since the shareholding crossed the 5% limit, he was required to make disclosure under Regulation 7(1) of SAST Regulations. "
F1315463402543_S86,allegation,It is alleged that he failed to make the said disclosure to Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) where the shares of GSML were listed at the relevant time thereby violated the said Regulation.
F1315463402543_S87,defendant claim,Mr. Akshay Poddar denied that he had violated the provisions of Regulation 7(1) of SAST Regulations.
F1315463402543_S88,material fact,"He had promptly made a disclosure to GSML and CSE on February 16, 2010 after completing the acquisition of 115,000 shares of GSML on February 15, 2010. "
F1315463402543_S89,material fact,"Based on the disclosure made by him, GSML also made matching disclosure to the CSE on February 16, 2010. "

F1315463402543_S93,material fact,I have considered the submissions made by Mr. Akshay Poddar and the documents submitted in support of his claim that he had made the disclosure about his aggregate shareholding voting rights in GSML to CSE when he crossed the 5% limit.
F1315463402543_S94,material fact," I find from the copies of documents submitted to me that Mr. Akshay Poddar had made the disclosures which were apparently received and acknowledged by the CSE on February 16, 2010. "
F1315463402543_S95,subjective observation,There is no substantive evidence to corroborate that Mr. Akshay Poddar failed to make the required disclosure to CSE as alleged. 
F1315463402543_S96,subjective observation,"I am therefore, inclined to give benefit of doubt to Mr. Akshay Poddar and conclude that the alleged violation of Regulation 7(1) of SAST Regulations does No stand established. "
F1315463402543_S97,procedural fact,"The last issue for consideration is whether Mr. Akshay Poddar, Mrs. Shradha Agarwala and M s. Indrakshi Trading Company Pvt Ltd had violated Regulation 11(2) of SAST Regulations."
F1315463402543_S98,material fact,The investigations revealed that the above Noticees are the promoters of GSML.

F1315463402543_S102,material fact,In terms of second proviso to Regulation 11(2) of the SAST Regulations the Noticees could have acquired any additional shares or voting rights upto 5% without making public announcement provided if the purchases are other than bulk deals i.e. No more than 0.5% of the listed capital per day.
F1315463402543_S103,material fact,"Mr. Akshay Poddar, Ku. Aeysha Poddar (minor daughter of Akshay Poddar), Mrs. Shradha Agarwala, Ku. Aasthi Agarwala and Ku. Anisha Agarwala (both minor daughters of Mrs. Shradha Agarwala) and M s. Indrakshi Trading Company Pvt Ltd purchased shares through bulk deals."
F1315463402543_S104,subjective observation,"Therefore, the exemption under Regulation 11(2) would No be available to them."
F1315463402543_S105,allegation,It is therefore alleged that the Noticees acquired the above shares without making the public announcement thereby violated Regulation 11(2) read with second proviso to Regulation 11(2) of SAST Regulations.
F1315463402543_S106,defendant claim,"The Noticees inter-alia submitted that a. “the second proviso to Regulation 11(2) of SAST Regulations is No applicable to them since the transaction of acquisition of 1,60,000 shares of GSML by them is exempt under Regulation 3(1)(e)(iii)(b) of SAST Regulations.
