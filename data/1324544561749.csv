"
F1324544561749_S61,statutory fact,"While determining the quantum of monetary penalty under section 15 A (b) and 15HB of the SEBI Act, it is important to consider the factors stipulated under section 15J of the SEBI Act, which reads as under:- 15J - Factors to be taken into account by the adjudicating officer While adjudging quantum of penalty under section 15-I, the adjudicating officer shall have due regard to the following factors, namely:- (a) the amount of disproportionate gain or unfair advantage, wherever quantifiable, made as a result of the default; (b) the amount of loss caused to an investor or group of investors as result of the default; (c) the repetitive nature of the default.

F1324544561749_S62,subjective observation,"In this regard, I would like to mention that from the material available on record, it is No possible to ascertain the disproportionate gain or unfair advantage which may have accrued to the Noticee or the loss that the investors would have incurred as a result of the aforesaid default by the Noticee. "
F1324544561749_S63,subjective observation,"However, the fact remains that failure on the part of the Noticee to take prompt and effective actions allowed its client to take substantial position in the shares of SCL without disclosing it to the Company or shareholders and also allowed misleading information to remain in public domain."
F1324544561749_S64,subjective observation," It is also observed that change in the shareholding and timely disclosures thereof, is of prime importance from the point of view of shareholders investors as that would have prompted them in making decision on investments or otherwise."
F1324544561749_S65,subjective observation,It would also be difficult to come to a firm conclusion as to how the general shareholders would have reacted on knowing the said change in the shareholding.
F1324544561749_S66,subjective observation,"On account of failure on the part of the Noticee to make the necessary disclosures on time and to take prompt and effective action, the fact remains that the concerned stakeholders were deprived of the important information at the relevant point of time."
F1324544561749_S67,subjective observation,There is nothing on record to show that the default of the Noticee is repetitive.
F1324544561749_S68,penalty,"Therefore, after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case, in exercise of the powers conferred upon me under Section 15 I of the Act and rule 5 of the Rules, I impose on the Noticee a penalty of 2,00,000 - (Rupees two lakh only) in terms of the provisions of Section 15A(b) of the SEBI Act for the violation of the provisions of regulation 7(1) of the SAST Regulations and regulation 13(1) of the PIT Regulations and a penalty of 1,00,000 - (Rupees one lakh only) under section 15HB of the SEBI Act for the violation of the provisions of Code of Conduct for Stock Brokers (i.e. a consolidated penalty of 3,00,000 -)."
